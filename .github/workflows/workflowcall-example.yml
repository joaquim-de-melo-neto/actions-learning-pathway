# How to make a workflow reusable
# Hereâ€™s an example from the build-test-deploy.yml workflow we created in the Automation Essentials module. 
# Below we updated the file to accommodate reusability. In addition to adding workflow_call, we also defined parameters allowing us to set the node-version. 
# Pay attention to the comments outlined in the code:

name: build-test-deploy
# Changed 'on' to enable this workflow to be called from other workflows
on:
  workflow_call:
    # Introduced 'inputs' to define parameters that can be passed when calling this workflow
    inputs:
      node-version:
        description: "Node version"
        required: true
        type: string

jobs: 
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps: 
      - name: checkout repo
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
      # Modified to use the node-version from the workflow inputs
      - name: use node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: ${{ inputs.node-version }}

      - run: npm install
      - run: npm run build

  test: 
    needs: build

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps: 
      - name: checkout repo
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
      # Modified to use the node-version from the workflow inputs
      - name: use node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: ${{ inputs.node-version }}
          
      - run: npm install
      - run: npm run test

# Now that we have updated our build-test-deploy workflow to accommodate reusability and we understand how to call a reusable workflow, let's put it all together. 
# In the example code below, we call the build-test-deploy workflow from a workflow located in a separate repository:

jobs:
  my-job:
    # Importing a reusable workflow from another repository and branch
    uses: organization/repo/.github/workflows/build-test-deploy.yml@main
    # Passing 'node-version' as an input parameter to the reusable workflow
    with:
      node-version: '18.x'
